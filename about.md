# About

You do not need to be a programmer to mentor at a Dojo! A lot of mentors are attendees' parents who have no technical 
experience at all when they start. Dojos benefit from having mentors with different skills, backgrounds, and levels 
of knowledge who provide support and encouragement to CoderDojo youth (Ninjas). The clubs also need general volunteers 
who focus on organising the events.
