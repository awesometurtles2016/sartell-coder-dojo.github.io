## What
A local, free admission, and volunteer run youth (ages 7-17) programming club. Club attendees, Coder Dojo calls them
**Ninjas**, come to learn about programming. Ninjas can work in groups or individually. Starter projects and other 
resources are available for Ninjas. Additionally, Volunteer mentors are there to help get started and assist with 
troubleshooting when things aren't working.

The session lasts two hours and follows the following format:
 * **Welcome and Introductions (5 minutes)**: Introduce mentors and Ninjas and discuss expectations.
 * **Icebreakers (5-15 minutes)**: To both introduce new Ninjas to other Dojo attendees and to create opportunities for 
   Ninjas to interact with one another, we will run icebreaker activities whenever several new Ninjas join a session, 
   and every so often even with established Ninjas.
 * **Make something cool with code (90 minutes)**: Ninjas work with the support of mentors to produce something with
   code. This can be a project from the CoderDojo resources site, an online coding tutorial, or it can be something the 
   Ninjas, with guidance from their mentors, have imagined and now want to create. 
                                                   
   Ninjas can work together in groups or alone, depending on the nature of their project and their preferences. They 
   are encouraged to keep in mind CoderDojo's principle of "Ask three, then me" and to help each other solve problems.
 * **Showcase your work (10-20 minutes)**: If they wish, Ninjas can take the opportunity to demonstrate what they built. 
 * **Wrap up (5 minutes)**: This is when we thank everyone for coming and make any announcements regarding future 
   sessions
