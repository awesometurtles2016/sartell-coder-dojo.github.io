## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sartell-coder-dojo/sartell-coder-dojo.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Testing locally

**Pre-requisites**
1. Install a full [Ruby development environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
2. Install Jekyll and bundler gems
   > gem install bundler jekyll
3. Install the gems from your `Gemfile`
   > bundle install
---
Once you've completed the pre-requisites, generate the live site by running 
> bundle exec jekyll serve

and, if all goes well, you should be able to access the site locally at http://127.0.0.1:4000

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sartell-coder-dojo/sartell-coder-dojo.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
